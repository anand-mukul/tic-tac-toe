A simple and fun Tic-Tac-Toe game created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This game supports dynamic grid expansion and timed moves to add more excitement and strategy to the traditional game.

## Game Instructions

2. Player X always goes first.
3. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
